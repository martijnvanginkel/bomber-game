- remove player on disconnect from the game also
- connect the tiles with the movement of the player and the map and the game. it's all over the place now and needs better organisation.
I want to just say player moves and then get it handled with the tiles and map and game automatically.
- 
    - in Player: moveMyself and moveOther need to be better. preferably just something dynamic for myself and others
    - in map: setTileOccupied doesn't feel right
    - in Game: the movement and adding players need to be better organised
